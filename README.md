#  Basic Logic Scripting – Day 1 (Scripts 1–10)

These are beginner-level Bash scripts focused on logic-building and flow understanding.  
Each script is short and meant for learning only — not production use.

---

## Script 1 – Static Text
**Goal:** Print simple information.  
**Concepts:** echo, script structure.  
**Logic:** Just prints name, date, and a line of text.

---

## Script 2 – Variables & Substitution
**Goal:** Learn to store and use variables.  
**Concepts:** variable assignment, echo with variables.  
**Logic:** Store name, course, and time → print them together.

---

## Script 3 – User Input
**Goal:** Accept user input and display it.  
**Concepts:** read command, dynamic variables.  
**Logic:** Ask user for a name → print greeting.

---

## Script 4 – If Condition
**Goal:** First decision-based script.  
**Concepts:** if / else structure, comparison.  
**Logic:** Ask for age → print “Adult” or “Minor”.

---

## Script 5 – File Existence Check
**Goal:** Verify if a file exists.  
**Concepts:** file test operators (-f, -e).  
**Logic:** Ask for filename → check → print “Found” or “Not found”.

---

## Script 6 – Simple Loop
**Goal:** Learn repetition logic.  
**Concepts:** for loop, sequence.  
**Logic:** Print numbers 1 to 5 with message per loop.

---

## Script 7 – Loop + Condition
**Goal:** Combine loops and decisions.  
**Concepts:** nested logic.  
**Logic:** Loop 1–10 → print “Even” or “Odd”.

---

## Script 8 – Exit Status
**Goal:** Introduce success/failure logic.  
**Concepts:** exit codes, conditional exits.  
**Logic:** Ask number → if >100 exit with 1, else exit 0.

---

## Script 9 – Counter Logic
**Goal:** Practice variable incrementing.  
**Concepts:** arithmetic in Bash, loop counter.  
**Logic:** Start count=0 → loop 5 times → print total loops done.

---

## Script 10 – Menu Logic
**Goal:** Learn branching using if/elif/else.  
**Concepts:** decision trees, user choice.  
**Logic:** Menu (1=Date, 2=List files, 3=Exit) → perform action based on choice.

---

###  Notes
- All scripts are intentionally simple to focus on *logic flow*.
- No external tools or files required.
- These scripts form your **Foundation Layer** — later ones will add logg
