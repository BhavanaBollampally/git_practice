#  Shell Scripting Drill — Scripts 1 to 25
**Author:** Bhavana
**Purpose:** Build strong logical reasoning and procedural fluency in Bash scripting through progressive, structured drills.

---

##  Overview
This scripting drill consists of **25 progressively complex Bash scripts**, divided into two phases:

- **Phase 1 (Scripts 1–10):** Logical foundation and syntax fluency.
- **Phase 2 (Scripts 11–25):** Practical reasoning, file handling, pattern matching, and modular scripting.

Each script strengthens a specific reasoning pattern — preparing for real-world DevOps automation scenarios.

##  Script Details

### **Phase 1 — Foundational Logic (Scripts 1–10)**

| Script | Title | Concept | Core Learning |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **1** | Print Basic Info | Echo and variable basics | Print user, date, and system info. |
| **2** | Variable Recall | String variables and insertion | Use stored variables and print in different formats. |
| **3** | User Input | Dynamic input with `read` | Accept input and echo it back dynamically. |
| **4** | Age Checker | Basic `if` condition | Apply binary logic (true/false) with numeric comparison. |
| **5** | File Existence Checker | `-f` file test operator | Check file presence using conditional logic. |
| **6** | Simple Loop | `for` loop fundamentals | Iterate through fixed ranges and print values. |
| **7** | Loop + Condition | Combined logic | Use conditionals inside loops to classify numbers. |
| **8** | Exit Status Simulation | Success/failure logic | Use `exit 0` and `exit 1` to simulate script success. |
| **9** | Counter Logic | Incrementing counters | Practice variable incrementation within loops. |
| **10** | Menu Logic | Multi-path selection | Use branching with menu-style decision flow. |

**Phase 1 Focus:** Syntax fluency, variable handling, and simple logical patterns.  
**Outcome:** Comfort with Bash basics, conditions, and structured repetition.

### **Phase 2 — Applied Logic & Modular Scripting (Scripts 11–25)**

| Script | Title | Concept | Core Learning |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **11** | Compare Two Numbers | Relational operators (`-gt`, `-lt`, `-eq`) | Compare integers and determine greater/equal. |
| **12** | Largest of Three Numbers | Nested `if` | Handle multi-layered comparisons. |
| **13** | Grade Evaluator | `elif` chains | Map numeric ranges to graded outcomes. |
| **14** | Simple Calculator | Arithmetic operations | Perform user-selected math using branching logic. |
| **15** | Even / Odd Counter | Loop + modulus | Classify and count even and odd values. |
| **16** | Positive / Negative / Zero Checker | Multi-branch decision | Identify sign-based conditions. |
| **17** | Factorial Calculator | Iterative multiplication | Strengthen arithmetic loop reasoning. |
| **18** | File Line Counter | File I/O with `while read` | Count lines dynamically from a file. |
| **19** | Vowel Counter | Character parsing | Loop through string characters and count vowels. |
| **20** | Reverse Number | Arithmetic reversal logic | Practice number manipulation and modular arithmetic. |
| **21** | File Line Reader | Stream-based looping | Read lines continuously until EOF. |
| **22** | Word Searcher | Exit status check with `grep` | True/false checking based on command success. |
| **23** | Log Analyzer Prototype | Compound conditions (`&&`, `||`) | Multi-condition decision-making for alerting. |
| **24** | Word Frequency Counter | Pattern detection and accumulation | Count word occurrences in a file with loops. |
| **25** | Function-based File Checker | Functions + arguments | Modularize logic and reuse via parameterized functions. |

**Phase 2 Focus:** File handling, condition chaining, pattern recognition, and function modularization.  
**Outcome:** Transition from procedural logic to automation-ready scripting.

##  Core Concepts Covered

| Area | Concepts Practiced |
|------|--------------------|
| **Conditionals** | `if`, `elif`, `else`, logical operators (`&&`, `||`) |
| **Loops** | `for`, `while`, nested iteration |
| **Arithmetic** | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, factorial and reversal logic |
| **File I/O** | Reading, checking, and validating file contents |
| **Pattern Matching** | Using `grep`, `[[ ]]`, and string scanning |
| **Functions** | Modular logic using `function_name() { ... }` and arguments |
| **Exit Status & Flow Control** | `exit`, `return`, and command exit codes |
| **Debugging & Error Handling** | Logical tracing, safe conditions, readable output |

##  Learning Outcomes
By completing Scripts 1–25:

- Achieved **line-by-line reasoning fluency** — from conditions → loops → modular code.  
- Developed **confidence in handling input, files, and logic flow.**  
- Built a **procedural thinking foundation** crucial for DevOps scripting (automation, monitoring, validation).  
- Learned **clean script structure and commenting style.**

---

##  Completion Summary
- All **25 scripts** executed and tested successfully.  
- Logical correctness and readability verified.  
- Code style: clean indentation, functional naming, modular logic.  
- Drill concludes the **Logic Conditioning Phase** — solid procedural base achieved.
